\section{Test environment}
All the machines used for testing purposes are Openstack virtual machines, with
the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 machine with 32GB of RAM, 8vCPU and solid state storage. This host was
used as final destination for packets;
\item 4 machines with 16GB of RAM, 6vCPU and solid state storage. These VMs
were utilized to form the Kubernetes cluster, on the top of which the SFC
infrastructure developed was running;
\item 1 machine with 4GB of RAM, 2vCPU and solid state storage. This host on
was used as client and on which run script to send packets.
\end{itemize}

\section{RTT measurement}
Regarding the delivery performance, the
\emph{round trip time} (RTT), the time interval between the instant in
which a packet is sent and when the response is received, is a metric to take
into consideration is. To analyze it we developed a Python script that sends a
packet (with 8B of payload) and waits for the correspondent response, recording
the instants (expressed as \emph{epoch}) of transmission and receiving. The goal
of this test is to compare the average RTT measured without involving any SFC 
(therefore simply delivering the packet to the receiver and get back the reply)
with the RTT in the case with packets pass through different length SFCs. In
particular, these experiments were repeated with chains that have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
and 10 hops respectively. A thing to keep in mind is that packets traverse the
SFC two times during the measurement. VNFs involved in this test only prints the
packet received and the total number of packets that have passed through it.
Results are collected after 100 repetitions of the test.

\begin{table}[H]

\end{tabular}
\caption{Mean RTT measured with different SFC length}
\label{chap:tests:sec:rtt:tab:meanrtt}
\end{table}

\noindent
Not surprisingly, as depicted in Table~\ref{chap:tests:sec:rtt:tab:meanrtt},
the RTT is larger when packets travel through the chain and it increases with
the total number of elements of the SFC. There is a great difference between
the mean RTT of the configuration without any chain and the one with an SFC
with a single link: this outcome has different explanation. As
described in~\ref{chap:impl:subsec:endpoints} the chain has always at
least 3 hops (ingress, VNF, egress), so the packet must be elaborated at least
by three different running software. Another interpretation lays into how the
code was written: components of this framework are not developed for production
purposes, but for a proof of concept, so that connections and transmissions can
be enhanced. Finally, network functions are meant to perform some modifications
to the packet, so, unavoidably, some time is required for their computation in
every implementation, even whether is more efficient than ours.

\end{figure}

\noindent
The results on average RTT are better represented in
Figure~\ref{chap:tests:sec:rtt:img:meanstt}. In that graph we can easily see
the difference among the different configurations. Looking at the bars in the
center, representing the SFCs composed by 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 links, we can see a
fairly linear increase of the RTT. This trend strongly depends on the nature of
the functions involved in the chain, and in this experiment the linear increase
is highlighted due to the usage of the same VNF for each hop. In
Figure~\ref{chap:tests:sec:rtt:img:differencertt} we can see the additional
time required for each transmission with the different SFCs, calculated as the
difference between the average RTT of a specific chain and the RTT measured
without involving any SFC. Even in that plot we can see a quite linear
increase depending on the length of the chain.

  \caption{Time difference between SFCs that have a length difference of one SF}
  \label{chap:tests:sec:rtt:img:differenceonehop}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Figure~\ref{chap:tests:sec:rtt:img:differenceonehop} represents the
difference in terms of average RTT between chains whose lengths differs only by
one link. The highest value was calculated bringing into comparison the direct
deliver of packets and the chain of only one element: even in that case is
remarked that SFC cost time in terms of transmission of a single packets.
Other deltas among RTT of different chains are quite similar, with a low
standard deviation, highlighting the linear trend.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
\toprule
\textbf{SFC Length} & \textbf{Jitter(Seconds)} \\ \midrule
len. 0    & 0.0001484817    \\
len. 1    & 0.0034793676    \\
len. 2    & 0.0040213103    \\
len. 3    & 0.0036568939    \\
len. 4    & 0.0031962546    \\

\end{tabular}
\caption{Jitter for different SFC lengths}
\label{chap:tests:sec:rtt:tab:jitter}
\end{table}

\noindent
Another metric to take in account is jitter. Jitter is the variation in the
delay of received packet, and it gives a measure of the congestion of the
network or underline other communication problems.
Table~\ref{chap:tests:sec:rtt:tab:jitter} represents the jitter calculated for
different SFC length, derived from values of RTT measured in the previous test.
As we can see values are really low, indicating no particular problems on the
network, even if the lowest result is always the one calculated without the
chain.

\section{Resilience}
Regarding the overall system resilience, we performed several tests in which
some nodes of our solution were stopped during a transmission. As a matter of
fact, one of the most important requirements of our implementation is to
make the system able to recover after an VNF crash. Exploiting Docker container
technology and Kubernetes platform gives a quite straightforward way to restart
a container after a fault. In fact, \texttt{YAML} files that allow to deploy
containers on Kubernetes, make it possible to set Pods' restart policy to
``always'' (the default one), ``on failure'' or ``never'', but the overall
system must be able to recognize that the VNF is brought up again. 

During this test we forwarded 500 packets (50ms each) from a sender
host to a receiver through an SFC composed by three hops. The \texttt{YAML} file
describing the chain is reported in Appendix~\ref{chap:testyaml} and can be
represented as in Figure~\ref{chap:tests:sec:fault:img:testfaultconf}.
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{testfaultconf}
  \caption{Host logical configuration for testing}
  \label{chap:tests:sec:fault:img:testfaultconf}
\end{figure}

\noindent
In that test we brought down the central link of the chain after $5$ seconds,
using the command \verb!kubectl delete pods <pod-id> --grace-period=0 --force!,
to force the stop of a Pod and we record the time it took for packets to arrive
to the receiver and pass through the VNF right before the one that would have
been stopped.

We performed the test using both UDP and TCP protocols, repeating the
measurement $20$ times for each protocol.
Figure~\ref{chap:tests:sec:fault:img:faultgraphudp} and
Figure~\ref{chap:tests:sec:fault:img:faultgraphtcp} represent the behavior of
the system during the experiment: blue points describe packet inter-arrival
time on the receiver, green ones the same metric on the SF that precede the
central one. The average interval of time in which the receiver did not receive
anything was $13.5793391228s$ in case of UDP and $13.7828050137s$ in case of
TCP. This is a good result, because in about $13s$ a container could crash, be
recreated and be operative again.

    \caption{Comparison among TCP and UDP in terms of packet time arrival in
    case of SF fault}
    \label{chap:tests:sec:fault:img:faultgrapht}
\end{figure}

Following those results, we repeated the test (this time only using UDP and
disabling all caching of the DNS requests performed by Dnsmasq on each Pods)
with the configuration shown in
Figure~\ref{chap:tests:sec:fault:img:testfaultconfwithreplica}, in order to
test the system resilience in case of a replica of a certain VNF. We repeated
this experiment 10 times, bringing down only one of the two replica of the same
SF and we were not able to record any significant interval of time in which the
receiver did not received packet (receiving times are consistent with sending
times). So we considered that in case of light traffic only two replicas of a
specific function could be enough to offer the final user a reliable service.

\section{Discussion}
The tests that we performed, even if they are not exhaustive, indicate that our
proposal can be a suitable approach in the SFC context.
The RTT calculated is higher in case during packet delivery SFCs are used
but it refers to the particular context, in which only a small packet have to
reach the destination. In other scenarios, with a larger traffic load and
machine located in different different sites, and exploiting VNFs that does not
only log the arrival of a packet, SFC can enhance the overall performance,
compressing data or performing some other optimization. The most important
result that we reached is to make the system able to recover after a really
short interval of time.
