\section*{\centering Abstract}
Current networks are expected to serve a wide range of verticals with
heterogeneous QoS/QoE requirements. One of the consequences will be an increase
of traffic volume on the core network side, demanding for specific solutions
able to scale with size while at the same time improve overall system
efficiency meeting application demands. The fifth generation of mobile
technology, recognized under the umbrella term of 5G, promises gains in terms
of efficiency and bandwidth, however, its early deployments are not expected
prior to 2020. 

Meanwhile, virtualization and the so called network softwarization technology
are mature enough and could be incrementally deployed in a 5G compliant
setting. In this context, Service Function Chaining (SFC) is an
application-driven networking approach providing the basis for specific flow
optimization in terms of simpler, optimized and interconnected network
functions, exploiting software as a driving force for innovation. To this end,
we propose a proof-of-concept implementation of the SFC paradigm exploiting
container technology.
